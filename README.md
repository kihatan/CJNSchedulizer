Schedule Planning Website
=========================

This was our group's final project for EECS 183.  It is based off of the Schedule Planning Website that was offered through the class.  We wanted to make a website that would help Animania: The University of Michigan Anime Club, and this is what we thought would help us the most.

The point of this website is to help us organize our 50 - 60 members for our yearly gathering, Con Ja Nai.  At Con Ja Nai we have our members watch over materials such as PlayStation 3s and Projectors.  To help our members decide when and where they will be "on shift" we are making this site to show them their options and give them possible schedules they could sign up for based on their choices.  

To see our site in action, visit <a href="http://cjnschedulizer.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"> cjnschedulizer.herokuapp.com </a> or download these files and run them locally.
